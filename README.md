# Java Internship at Cognifys

## Overview

This repository showcases the completion of my Java internship at Cognifys. The internship consisted of two levels, each containing specific tasks related to Java programming.

## Level 1

### Tasks Completed

1. **Temperature Converter**
   - Description: Create a Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Prompt the user to enter a temperature value and the unit of measurement, and then perform the conversion. Display the converted temperature.
   - Skills: Basic input/output operations, arithmetic operations.

2. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Description: Implement a Java program that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backward, ignoring spaces and punctuation.
   - Skills: String manipulation, loops, conditional statements.

3. **Student Grade Calculator**
   - Description: Create a Java program that calculates and displays the average grade of a student. Prompt the user to enter the number of grades to be entered, and then input each grade. Calculate the average and display it to the user.
   - Skills: Loops, arrays, basic arithmetic operations.

4. **Random Password Generator**
   - Description: Build a Java program that generates a random password for the user. Prompt the user to enter the desired length of the password and specify whether it should include numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters. Generate the password accordingly and display it to the user.
   - Skills: Random number generation, string manipulation, user input.

## Level 2

### Tasks Completed

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - Description: Implement a two-player tic-tac-toe game. Display the game board and prompt each player to enter their moves. Check for a winning condition or a draw after each move and display the result accordingly. Allow the players to play multiple rounds if desired.
   - Skills: Arrays or matrices, loops, conditional statements.

2. **Password Strength Checker**
   - Description: Create a program that checks the strength of a password. Prompt the user to input a password and analyze its strength based on certain criteria, such as length, the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback on the password strength.
   - Skills: String manipulation, conditional statements.

3. **File Encryption/Decryption**
   - Description: Create a Java program that encrypts or decrypts the contents of a text file using a simple encryption algorithm. Prompt the user to choose between encryption or decryption, and input the file name or path. Encrypt or decrypt the file accordingly and save the result to a new file.
   - Skills: File handling, string manipulation, basic input/output operations.

## Conclusion

I successfully completed the Java internship at Cognifys, gaining valuable experience in Java programming and enhancing my skills in various areas such as string manipulation, file handling, and algorithm implementation. The tasks undertaken in both levels provided a comprehensive understanding of Java and its application in real-world scenarios.
